# Employee API

This project is a simple Employee Management API built with C# and .NET 6.0. It uses Entity Framework Core as an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) and SQL Server as the database.

## Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET 6.0
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server
- Swagger
- Bogus

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several folders:

- `Entities`: Contains the entity classes `Employee` and `Group` which map to the `m_employee` and `m_group` tables in the database respectively.
- `Services`: Contains the service classes which contain the business logic of the application.
- `Controllers`: Contains the controller classes which handle the HTTP requests and responses.
- `Repositories`: Contains the repository classes which handle the database operations.
- `Models`: Contains the model classes which are used to transfer data between the API and the client.
- `Migrations`: Contains the database migration files generated by Entity Framework Core.
- `Factories`: Contains the `DatabaseSeeder` class which seeds the database with initial data.
- `Extensions`: Contains the `DependencyInjectionExtension` class which sets up the dependency injection for the project.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in JetBrains Rider 2024.1.1 or any other .NET compatible IDE.
3. Update the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file to point to your SQL Server instance.
4. Run the command `dotnet ef database update` to apply the migrations and create the database.
5. Run the project.

## Usage

The API exposes several endpoints for managing employees and groups:

- `GET /api/employees`: Fetch all employees.
- `POST /api/employees`: Create a new employee.
- `GET /api/employees/{id}`: Fetch a specific employee by ID.
- `PUT /api/employees`: Update a specific employee by ID.
- `GET /api/groups`: Fetch all groups.
- `POST /api/groups`: Create a new group.
- `GET /api/groups/{id}`: Fetch a specific group by ID.
- `PUT /api/groups`: Update a specific group by ID.

Similar endpoints are available for managing groups.
